# üìù Day 5: Understanding the Logical Processing Order of SQL Clauses

> **Objective:** Learn the logical (not syntactical) order in which SQL clauses are processed by the database engine. This knowledge will help you write accurate and efficient queries.

## üîç Overview

Even though we write SQL queries starting with `SELECT`, the database engine processes them in a specific **logical order**. Knowing this helps avoid confusion and prevents common mistakes like referencing aliases too early or misusing `HAVING`.

## üß© The Logical Processing Order of SQL Clauses

Here‚Äôs the correct **logical processing sequence** used by SQL engines:

| Step | Clause      | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 1    | `FROM`      | Choose tables and perform joins to get base data |
| 2    | `WHERE`     | Filter rows from the base data |
| 3    | `GROUP BY`  | Group the filtered data for aggregation |
| 4    | `HAVING`    | Filter groups based on aggregated values |
| 5    | `SELECT`    | Define what columns or expressions to return |
| 6    | `DISTINCT`  | Remove duplicate rows from the result set |
| 7    | `ORDER BY`  | Sort the final result set |
| 8    | `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` | Limit the number of rows returned |

## üß† Why It Matters

Understanding this order explains:
- Why you can't reference an alias from `SELECT` in the `WHERE` clause
- Why `HAVING` is used instead of `WHERE` when filtering aggregations
- Why `ORDER BY` must come after most other clauses
- Why `LIMIT` applies only to the final sorted result

## üìù Example Query Explained Step-by-Step

### Query:
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **`FROM employees`**  
   - Load the `employees` table and any joined tables.

2. **`WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'`**  
   - Keep only employees hired after January 1, 2020.

3. **`GROUP BY department`**  
   - Group remaining rows by department.

4. **`HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000`**  
   - Keep only departments where average salary exceeds $60,000.

5. **`SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary`**  
   - Return department name and average salary.

6. **`DISTINCT`** *(implied if used)*  
   - Remove duplicates (if explicitly used).

7. **`ORDER BY avg_salary DESC`**  
   - Sort results by highest average salary.

8. **`LIMIT 5`**  
   - Show only top 5 departments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Mistake | Explanation | Fix |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Using alias in `WHERE` | Aliases defined in `SELECT` aren‚Äôt available until later | Use full expression or move filtering earlier |
| Filtering aggregates in `WHERE` | Aggregates not available yet | Use `HAVING` instead |
| Referencing column position in `HAVING` | Not always supported | Use actual aggregate expression |
| Using `LIMIT` without `ORDER BY` | Results may be inconsistent | Always sort before limiting |

## üìå Summary Table

| Clause       | Logical Order | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| `FROM`       | 1             | Joins happen here |
| `WHERE`      | 2             | Filters raw rows |
| `GROUP BY`   | 3             | Groups rows for aggregation |
| `HAVING`     | 4             | Filters grouped data |
| `SELECT`     | 5             | Defines output columns |
| `DISTINCT`   | 6             | Removes duplicates |
| `ORDER BY`   | 7             | Sorts final output |
| `LIMIT`      | 8             | Limits final result count |

## üí° Pro Tips

- Always think about what data exists at each step.
- Use `HAVING` only when filtering aggregated values (`AVG`, `SUM`, etc.)
- Avoid using `SELECT` aliases in `WHERE` ‚Äî use full expressions instead.
- `ORDER BY` can reference `SELECT` aliases because it runs *after* `SELECT`.
